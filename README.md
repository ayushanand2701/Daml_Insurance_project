# üõ†Ô∏è Daml_Insurance_company üõ†Ô∏è 
DamlMeetup is an application built on DAML that offers a platform for Insurance management and diffe policy rent organization.

### I. Overview 
This project was created by using the `empty-skeleton` template. Invite/Accept design pattern is used to create this DAML application.
The insurance application system is designed to facilitate the management of insurance policies between customers (policy applicants) and insurers (insurance companies). It provides a structured workflow for applying for, accepting, renewing, canceling, and managing insurance policies.
              


### II. Workflow
1.	Customer (policy applicant):
2.	Submit an insurance application.
3.	Accept or reject an insurance proposal.
4.	Renew an existing insurance policy.
5.	Cancel an insurance policy during the free period.
6.	Insurer (insurance company):
7.	Provide a quote for an insurance application.
8.	Initiate a medical checkup request for the customer.
9.	Terminate an insurance policy.
10.	Approve the cancellation of an insurance policy.
11.	Confirm payments made by the customer.
